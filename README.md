QtVlc
=====

a Qt library around libvlc

Qt5
---

QtVlc is Qt5 ONLY.

Note that your app (as well as the demo app) will crash when the qt4 interface plugin is available to the linked libvlc library.
Hopes are that libvlc will stop lazy-loading plugins. until then, this library is probably pretty useless :P

License
-------

QtVlc is mostly LGPL, but parts of QtVlcWidgets are GPL due to code taken from the VLC Qt4 interface plugin sources that are licensed under GPL

see the individual source files.
